Cyclosporine,"""i have used restasis for about a year now and have seen almost no progress.  for most of my life i've had red and bothersome eyes. after trying various eye drops, my doctor recommended restasis.  he said it typically takes 3 to 6 months for it to really kick in but it never did kick in.  when i put the drops in it burns my eyes for the first 30 - 40 minutes.  i've talked with my doctor about this and he said it is normal but should go away after some time, but it hasn't. every year around spring time my eyes get terrible irritated  and this year has been the same (maybe even worse than other years) even though i've been using restasis for a year now. the only difference i notice was for the first couple weeks, but now i'm ready to move on.""",2
Etonogestrel,"""my experience has been somewhat mixed. i have been using implanon now for nearly 14 months and have decided to get it removed because i bleed every day, all day. i would occasionally stain my underwear and my sheets. it didn't start out that way, for the first month i didn't bleed at all, then i had an epic two week period, then everything was irregular, which has basically been my new norm, sadly. 

i decided to get rid of the implanon because of the endless bleeding. i should mention that the bleeding was usually pretty light, a bit more than spotting but not quite a period either. other than the endless bleeding, i've been pretty side effect free, except for minor acne.

Hydroxyzine,"""i recommend taking as prescribed, and the bottle usually says ""take x amount every x hours"". i think that having a steady stream of any medication is the only way to have it work. this medication's only side effect i have found is almost exactly like when one takes benadryl, and only when you are first starting out on it. i am used to it now after 3 weeks and the only effect i notice is that my hands no longer shake and my mind is at ease. much better and smoother than other meds like xanax or tramadol or klonopin, etc., etc. """,10

Epiduo,"""love it. i had the worst breakouts, so i got epiduo. when i used it the first time it showed results the next day. i continue to use it and i almost don't have a single breakout and i've only been using it for a week. it also helps with redness and acne scars. i love my new skin and you will too.""",9

Suprep Bowel Prep Kit,"""not as bad as i was expecting.  the taste is like salty cough syrup, but better than nyquil.  the volume to drink wasn't insurmountable.  and the effect of the wasn't violent.  just know that anything you drink after ingesting the dose will be passed soon afterwards for about then next 4 hours.  based on all the reviews of other methods, this seems to be the mildest.""",8

Etonogestrel,"""nexplanon is horrible if you already suffer from depression or anxiety. nobody told me not take it due to my clinical depression, so i got it, thinking it would be great to not have to worry about condoms with my boyfriend or getting pregnant. i had just about every side effect listed on their site, from mood swings, to even being diagnosed with vaginitis due to the implant. i had a period that lasted four months. i got so depressed i was having really dark thoughts, and i was always dizzy and tired. being on nexplanon was the worst nine months of my life. but, it did protect me from pregnancy. not to mention, nobody really knows if it increases the chances of getting breast cancer. over all... i wouldn't risk it.""",3

the only bothersome thing about it is a began to break out a little more - i've always had acne problems but these have been more cystic acne than usual. it seems to be calming down though. also, i get a lot of fuzz stuck the the adhesive on the patch itself, so i just pick it off if it gets to be noticeable.

Elocon,"""took my son to the allergist for testing, but he couldn't due to raised bumps on back so he prescribed elocon, i got the generic solution that comes in a squeeze dropper. i apply about 6 drops to affected area followed by cruel lotion which is good for replacing ceramides and hydration.  i started late evening by the following morning i saw big improvement, by day 3 my son was a new person. very satisfied so far hope he doesn't relapse""",10
TriNessa,"""i was prescribed trinessa by my doctor in september of 2015 and have been taking it ever since. this is the only form of birth control that i have been on, which is why i gave it 9/10. it works very well. prior to taking trinessa, i had some acne but ever since, i have clear skin and rarely ever get a pimple. i had one minor headache when i first began taking this medicine but have not had one since. make sure that you eat before or immediately after taking the pill, otherwise you will feel nauseous. my periods are much lighter and cramps are almost nonexistent. i definitely recommend this as a birth control.""",9

Abilify,"""i was first put on abilify in 2004. it is very effective, and has been the most useful medication for me. i have developed gallstones, have a fatty liver and have high triglycerides. it is definitely not because of my diet. i was a vegan for 23 years and i am very strict with what i eat. i now have to get my gallbladder removed and i think it has to do with taking psychiatric drugs over the years. it is well noted now that abilify causes gallstones, a fatty liver and high triglycerides. i have been in constant pain for three months and just now, after 12 years of taking abilify, may discontinue the use and start something new. overall, for the mood disorder this was highly effective and useful in treating my bipolar depression.""",7

Gianvi,"""i am 14 years old and i am taking this pill for several reasons: acne, bad menstrual cramps and heavy periods. so far it has cleared up my acne way faster then anything else i've tried, but i am on two other pills for acne as well, so it could be the combined effects. it hasn't had much of an effect on my period itself, but the cramps are way less. the downside to this medication is that it makes me feel really nauseous. i've tried taking the pill with a meal or a snack, but nothing helps. this pill makes me vomit if i eat more then a few bites at once. the pill made my breasts grow up a size (which is weird considering the weight loss from not being able to eat). if you're just looking for a birth control, look elsewhere.""",6

Monistat 3-Day Combination Pack,"""i was scared to take this because of the reviews but i experienced zero burning or itching from the medication. i had itching from the yeast infection but not excessive itching that was said in the reviews. every body reacts to medicines differently so don't completely write off trying monistat just because of the bad reviews below. i didn't experience any of that and i felt relief on the second day and now is completely gone. i took it night and tried not to get up a lot until the morning. the ointment also somewhat helped.""",9
Roflumilast,"""daliresp has been a game changer for me.  my copd symptoms have been substantially reduced as i became quite winded after a short walk of 100-125 feet. now after about four months on this medicine my shortness of breath has been reduced and is sometimes non-existent.  during the four months i had to deal with severe bouts of insomnia. this was solved by taking 1/2 pill per day.  i notice no difference in symptoms between one or 1/2 pill.""",10
Bupropion,"""2 and 1/2 months on wb. quality of life improved significantly. i am more emotionally resilient, have an increase in daily energy and i feel more motivated to do the things that were languishing on the back burner before. i have been on other ads and this one is different; it didn't numb me, it lifted me up. the range of emotions is still there. but the difference is i can come back from sadness without being a total mess. it hasn't made me a better person, it's just made life less of an uphill battle. i've lost 20 of the 30 lbs i needed to lose so far too. cons: lengthy start up phase (7 weeks for me) requires lots of patience, plus i couldn't sleep properly on wellbutrin without my trazodone at night.""",9
Propofol,"""was given this for a colonoscopy.  was knocked out quickly and woke up without nausea.  i did develop a very sore neck and shoulders afterwards.  do not know if this was from sleeping wrong or from the drug.""",10

Royal jelly,"""i've taken royal jelly for years & have found it to be one the best herbal supplements available. i used the ""non freeze dried"" kind.  it was a little more expensive but well worth it.  it took me off caffeine without any headaches.  it gave me energy without any type of rush feeling.  i simply was able to do more longer without feeling tired or like i had caffeine in my system.  within two weeks, people started commenting on my skin & how good it looked.  there was such a noticeable difference. my hair started growing even faster.  i didn't know all these things would happen.  i ordered it for the energy benefits alone & got so much more. i am a firm believer in quality royal jelly.""",10

Etonogestrel,"""nexplanon does its job. i can have worry free sex. the only thing is that my periods are sometimes light and sometimes heavy. sometimes they go away and sometimes they show up unexpected. i also feel somewhat depressed. not sure if its nexplanon or not. i've had nexplanont for about 2 months now, but despite the side effects its the most effective birth control i've ever used and i do not plan on taking it out.""",9
Suprep Bowel Prep Kit,"""for me this prep solution was a good alternative. i liked that it was just about like drinking water so i could just chug it down, get it over with. i bit down on a couple of lemon wedges afterward to kill the very strong after taste. it was a lot of liquid to drink in a short time and getting up in the middle of the night to do it again was not my favorite part. i am pretty certain, however,  that i am well prepared for an effective scope.  also, i had minimal cramping and discomfort after ingestion which was nice. overall, i much prefer it over the preparations i have used in the past.""",8
Copper,"""my cnp was very knowledgeable, friendly, and gentle with me. she informed me that there would be, ""three large cramps"" with this procedure, and she was not kidding.the cramps were the most intense i've ever felt, she said women who've had children compared them to minor contractions. for women, like me, who haven't had children opening your cervix is not pleasant and is very painful. i had to make her stop due to becoming lightheaded. the whole thing was very short, it was over within 5 minutes. i did have to lay on the table since i was prone to fainting. take ibuprofen an hour before, and don't drive yourself! my cramps have been very severe ever since i got it done 4 hours ago, even on 1,000mg of ibuprofen, 20mg tramadol, 100mg naproxen""",8
Goserelin,"""this drug has been good, it has stopped my periods & pain i was getting.. the injections aren't as bad as i thought, have had little symptoms, such as; body hair loss, little weight gain, feeling better, slight increase with sweating, lower in sex drive and feeling more bloated then usual.""",9
Plan B One-Step,"""taken pill day after intercourse. this is no the first time i've used the pill. this time was a lot different from others. i had been on the day of my period when i had unprotected sex. after i took the pill i immediately started bleeding again, starts cramping and had diarrhea. the fist time i used the pill i had blood clots the size of quarters come out, but this time there is just a lot of blood. very painful. but it seems it is normal for this to happen.""",10
Mefenamic acid,"""this did not work at all. not only did it not touch my severe menstrual cramps, but i experienced side effects from the drug - muscle weakness in my legs. my obgyn and i tried everything. now, i take meloxicam every 24 hrs for first 1-3 days of period and take 2.5mg - 5mg hydrocodone acetaminophen on day 2 and 3 for breakthrough pain. it works very well.""",1
Aviane,"""positives: i've been on this pill for over a year and it's alright; i'd be terrified to try another one. 3-day, perfectly timed period with light bleeding compared to my natural heavy and often painful one. my skin is pretty clear and i now forgo makeup altogether. 

negatives: i have had increased headaches, ranging from 0-3 per week depending on my stress level, but if you can avoid stress, it shouldn't be too bad. i don't like that my ovulation mucus is gone; i loved knowing myself that way, but most women probably don't care. also, i think my sex-drive may have decreased a bit although i still seek the deed.

( /-) i did get extremely nauseous when i started taking it in the morning, but switched to nighttime and largely eliminated that problem.""",8
Pro-Den Rx,"""i have experienced severe dry mouth after using pro-denrx aqueous gel for teeth brushing.  i used it for three weeks before i finally realized that my dry mouth started when i began the use of the toothpaste.  i have stopped using pro-denrx and hope the side effects will eventually disappear.  it has only been two days since i stopped use, so it is too early to tell much.  my mouth is still severely dry.""",1
Betamethasone,"""i had severe blisters on my hands and wrists.  the blisters were in various stages, some forming under the skin, some filled fluid, some ruptured.  i had 50  blisters on my left hand & wrist and about half that number on my right hand & wrist.  the pain, burning, piercing pain was extreme.  my doctor prescribed several different creams that did not work and then this betamethasone lotion.  i finally had relief.  this worked within minutes to relieve the pain and within 2 days to see amazing clearing of the blisters.  i am so grateful for this medication.""",10
Atenolol,"""this was prescribed for hypertension, and so far as i can tell i have had no problems with it. i cannot say whether it helps with anxiety, although my doctor said to take one when i felt as though my heart was racing. it seemed to help, but i do not know whether it was because of the tenormin or the placebo effect.""",9
Phenelzine,"""i tried many medications and many combinations with little or no effect.  as a last effort, i turned to the internet and stumbled across some positive info about nardil.  it took awhile to even find a doctor that would prescribe it.  i have now been on 90 mgs for around four or five years and it works very well with few unwanted side effects.  i take it in combination with 20mgs of zyprexa for a very severe form of generalized anxiety that i have.""",10
Plan B,"""i have taken plan b multiple times and for the most part it worked. however the last time i took it i started what i thought was my period and went to go have a surgery. they tested me and found out i was pregnant. moral of the story is even if you think you got your ""period"" take a test to be safe.""",5
Monistat 7,"""i took monistat 7 last night and it was okay. but this morning i woke up and it was burning it was causing me a lot of discomfort. i took a shower with cool water to try to rinse out the rest of the medication but, it did not work. since i am still burning i'm going to stop using the medication and visit my doctor because it's not getting better. i'm extremely upset because i took an over-the-counter test before you treat and the stick remained yellow so it said if it's yellow that means you have a yeast infection but when i took the medication monistat 7 i started burning and having lots of irritation. prior to me taking this medication i did not have any burning non itching just a slight irritation and discharge.will never use again.""",1
Remeron,"""i was on remeron for about 2 years before.  helped very very much with my depression.  but although i often felt very sleepy near the beginning of the treatment, the massive fatigue eventually subsided to an acceptable level.  20-mins after taking it, i'm ready for bed i can't keep my eyes open no matter what.

i just restarted remeron two days ago, after more than a year being on it.  as i type this, i feel fogged over, sort of sleepy, and immensely ""munchie"".  as before when i took it, i'd find myself waking up several times a night going to raid the fridge and cabinets for munchie or sweet foods (and meats! definitely craved meat all the time).  so again, on remeron: eating again, sleeping some, more relaxed, less sad.

Ethinyl estradiol / etonogestrel,"""i have had some side effects. really heavy periods and about two days after i take it out, i have extreme hot flashes that make me extremely warm. i was out on a very cold day when this last happened, my head was just about soaked with sweat.""",7
OnabotulinumtoxinA,"""i had 40+ injections of 200 units of botox for migraine approximately two and a half weeks ago. the first few days were horrible, as they made my migraines worse. now my migraines have reduced (which is awesome), but i have horrible pain in my arms and hands that i've never experienced before. my forearm muscles won't flex, so somehow the toxin spread rather far away. my mouth is extremely dry as well and i have difficulty swallowing. the pain in my arms is unbearable at times. i do not recommend botox at all, despite the reduction in migraines. i will never get this again.
also my face looks completely foreign to me and i'm embarrassed to be in public or make eye contact with anyone.""",3
Mirena,"""i haven't had my mirena for as long as everyone else, but i have to say that so far everything is great! i am 22 with no kids, but i'm moving in with my long term boyfriend soon and don't want to have to constantly worry about being pregnant. i won't lie, insertion for me was horrible. the pain was pretty bad, but went away almost instantly after removal of all of the other stuff. i felt pretty bad for the rest of the day and cramped for the next few with a bit of very light spotting, but i haven't had any spotting in the last week and just have the occasional cramp. i have felt for the strings and it kinda freaks me out that i can feel them, but my boyfriend hasn't mentioned being able to feel them. all in all, it's much better than the pill that i was on and i'm happy with my mirena so far!""",10
Efavirenz / emtricitabine / tenofovir,"""i've been on atripla now for 2 months and it's a great drug. there were defiantly some wicked side effects, strange dreams, frequent bathroom trips and mild hallucinations, but after a few weeks they were gone and in 3 weeks i went from a viral load of over 35,000 to undetectable.

Paxil,"""at first, i was a little bit afraid to try paxil after reading some reviews but i thought to myself anything has to be better than the daily stress and anxiety that i was dealing with.  i've been on it for a month and i can absolutely say it's been a life changing experience! i no longer have daily panic attacks and i can go out in public without a care! before paxil, i struggled in public situations. i would often feel anxiety and if everyone was staring and judging me. but now i don't even think about it. i just go on with my business and enjoy my days! if you're struggling with daily panic attacks and anxiety like i was, i highly recommend at least giving it a try!""",10

Chantix,"""here is what nicotine does to your brain...
nicotine also can have effects on the parts of the brain that sense pleasure. when nicotine gets into the brain, it is able to stimulate the release of a neurotransmitter called dopamine. dopamine activates some of the neurons in the part of the brain that register pleasure. as a result, nicotine triggers a chemical sensation of pleasure, which causes people to associate tobacco use with a feeling of pleasure.
here is what chantix does to it...

hyperfocus is a huge problem that alluded me for a few months. because adderall affects the brain, it distorts the user's reality. i felt that i was getting a lot done, and it wasn't until my colleagues at work told me that i was garbage at multitasking that i realized my dose was too high. beware of this. focus =/= productivity""",8

from 8.7 to 6.4 the first 6 mths. i think the weight loss and loss of appetite helped to lower the a1c as much as the medication.  but, who cares? i think my body is getting immune to it because i seem to be at a level where i'm no longer improving but i am holding at these levels which are much better than where i started.  i also take 2000 of metformin a day along with 2000 mg of cinnamon but these along with glipizide wasn't enough.  thanks to the invokana i'm in a much better healthy condition.""",9

Buprenorphine / naloxone,"""i'm an addict and the first time i took it it did take away the withdrawal symptoms after about a few days into taking it (8mg 2 naloxone) tabs once a day it gave me severe headaches and sometimes made me feel sick. the pros to this medicine is it does keep the withdrawals at bay and is easier to withdraw from than methadone. cons is the cost for me with no insurance is too high like 400.00 for a months supply! i know it works for some but not me! 5 out of 10.""",5

i'm on 60mg of vyvanse for adhd currently, but i've been prescribed it for awhile.
what can i say about this medicine? it's great! yes, it suppresses the appetite a little, and sometimes i have to force myself to eat. 
this medication doesn't alter my personality oddly like adderall. i'm still me, just more focused. my only complaint is that it mostly wears off in the evening when i need focus. i'm a singer too, so dry mouth is a side-effect that i could do without.""",9

Zolpidem,"""i suffer with sleep duration insomnia. mostly i fall asleep naturally for two hours then perhaps drop off naturally once more for an hour; after that i wake and cannot fall asleep without zolpidem. 

the insomnia seems to be caused by general anxiety and a mind that will not stop holding internal conversations even when i am exhausted. i take 1/4 x10mg zolpidem which at best gives three hours sleep; i repeat this at least once over the night. it's been like this for some years with no side effects, tolerance, addiction or rebound insomnia noticeable. overall this is the best sedative for me as it leaves no drowsiness the next day. my wish would be for a longer sedative action.""",8
Bupropion,"""day 1 of taking wellbutrin xl, i was the most positive i've been in a long time. i had a very vivid colorful dream that first night, the first time i've ever dreamt in color (that i can remember). the dreams subsided after day one, but the medication continued to make me feel better. i'm about 2 months in, and it's been absolutely amazing in treating my depression. my motivation has drastically skyrocketed, and i feel more positive and optimistic about life.""",9

Dupixent,"""i wrote back in may and wanted to follow up since it has now been 4 months.  my allergist was a bit disappointed as i still have some eczema -- i am about 70 percent clearer.  i haven't been using any steroid creams so maybe with those we would see better results. 
i did go through a crazy flaky period on my face/scalp/arms.  i finally used some tar shampoo and tea tree oil to get through that it lasted a good 8 to 10 weeks. 
my skin does feel much softer, my husband has commented several times. 
i think the most noticeable thing for me is the itch is gone.  that alone is worth the shots to me. i wish i had better luck with clearer skin. we don't realize how much we scratch ourselves without even thinking, until we stop.""",7

i didnt have my period the first two weeks, and then all i had was spotting. the weird thing is its pretty inconsistent, like sometimes every other day there's spotting. but i really don't mind, no cramps, no acne, no mood swings, i actually lost a little bit of weight without trying to. i just use a panty liner everyday, usually there's nothing but just in case. i'm really happy with it.""",9

3) neglect to mention all the side effects- including an alarmingly high rate of suicidal thoughts

Cymbalta,"""i saw this medication as a marvel, until i started taking it. i had no problems, except for some nausea, during the first 2-3 months i was on it. and it seemed to help somewhat with pain. then the fun began: restless legs syndrome, insomnia, horrible sweating even when it was cold, urinary incontinence and frequency, muscle spasms, elevated liver enzymes...but hey, there's another medication for all those side effects. finally after 3 years, i had had enough and was ready to move on. unfortunately, the lilly recommended taper is downright dangerous. after the alternating 60mg/30mg and drop to 30 mg, i was in full blown cymbalta discontinuation syndrome.  look it up; it's not pretty. run away from this med as fast as you can.""",1
Lamotrigine,"""i am diagnosed with major depression. my doctor added lamictal because wellbutrin alone was not effective. the addition of lamictal improved my symptoms and maintained this improvement.  there are three side effects i get with it.  i get mild nausea, mild euphoria and sleepiness.  i highly recommend it. my doctor says he has great results using it with his patients.""",9
Lorcaserin,"""just started belviq, slight headache first day, which subsided, but i noticed the superhuman ability to say no to snacking. i opened the fridge and didn't want anything. noticed bursts of ""i need to get up and do something"".  my first night sleep was just so comfortable.  will power in a bottle.""",10
Vivitrol,"""after partying almost 30 years in a successful, trouble free life, i began taking antabuse pills a few years ago without a recovery program.  i was told about vivitrol and it interested me in quitting my prescription hydrocodone, benzo, and drinking. my 1st shot was 10 days ago and it does make your mind content. i can tell the drug is wrapped around my receptors. if i where to attempt to take a drink....it feels like i already had one. not taking pills is no big deal either. i still take a sleep aid at night and aleve  or ibuprofen for anything else. i. am now experiencing eating and sleeping like i've seen normal people do all my life.  a spiritual feeling should come along with that for those of you who are willing to make a change.""",8
Lacosamide,"""though not indicated in the literature, i found that a few days after starting the vimpat titration kit i began to experience extreme soreness in the legs.  it may not have been from the medication but i had not done any physical activity that would have caused such soreness in the muscles in my legs and lower extremities. though i cannot say for certain that it was a side effect of taking vimpat it does seem that the symptoms only emerged a couple of days after beginning the titration kit of vimpat 50 mg twice a day leading to vimpat 100mg twice a day. i am interested in sharing this to see if anyone else has had similar experiences because this is not a symptom listed in the medicine guide or any other lists of side effects of vimpat.""",6
Buprenorphine / naloxone,"""suboxone are opiate-based meds, a substitute for heroine and other opioids, and therefore addictive. besides helping with withdrawal, it also made the cravings go away. like this you can put some distance between your addiction years and your new, clean life. getting off suboxone is also not easy, but nothing compared to heroine-kicking. doctors are supposed to help you lower your dosage. in the end i took a quarter of a 2mg/0.5mg pill every day, until one day i felt like not taking it anymore. there is no wonder cure for opiate addiction (duh!), there will always be pain and discomfort, the only thing you can try is to minimize that! after 9 years of heroine and 3.9 years on suboxone, i finally managed to get off. i definitely recommend it!""",10

Viibryd,"""i have been on zoloft and celexa, both just taking the edge off, for the last 7 yrs. i had been in a pretty deep depression for the last few months, so my pcp suggested viibryd. she told me to take it in the morning with food for the nausea. i took the 10mg dose with half my daily celexa dose for the first week. i felt a difference on day 1. the clutter cleared up, unreasonable emotions were easier to control, i actually felt happy. i have experienced mild gastrointestinal issues, evening sweets cravings and stomach bloat, none of which i realized were side effects until reading up here. i am now on my second week of 40mg/day doses, feeling great. i combat the restless leg (read: whole body) by dosing in the morning with food. i have very high hopes for this medicine.""",8
Prednisone,"""i had a choking/allergic reaction where my throat swelled as well as my vocal chords, it was scary but i'm glad it happened because i was living with a lot of pain that the prednisone helped from a bike accident as well as other issues. i just took it for 5 days & i did take a 5 mg about 3 weeks later as a maintenance dose. as far as the anxiety goes my body adjusted to that after a couple days then it dissipated once i stopped taking it. i did gain 6 lbs & hit kept me awake first couple nights. the positive out weighs the side effects for me especially  with a short term dosage""",8
Aspirin / dipyridamole,"""i had been taking plavix without any side effects since experiencing transient ischemic stroke, but was advised by my doctor to try aggrenox because a clotting test raised a question whether plavix was effective. to start with i took one dose per day because i had had been advised to expect headaches until my body adjusted.  i felt my head was going to explode and got extremely nauseated. i took it for three days.  the headaches got worse, and i became nauseous, and my blood pressure went very high. i now list aggrenox as a medication that i am allergic to because of the severe side effects. i continue to use aspirin, plavix and other medications to try to prevent strokes.""",1
Celexa,"""i work for a large fire department.  i was having a tough time with some bad calls.  no sleep, always feeling like i'm in trouble, like i'm drowning and no one can help me.  my doctor put me on celexa and life came back.  i worry about the things i need to be worried about and don't stress about the things that shouldn't stress me.  i feel ""normal"" again.  i believe it saved my career.""",8
Tramadol,"""i was prescribed this for a tooth infection. it did nothing to help elevate pain except when i added tylenol and ibuprofen. i was also taking antibiotics at the time. since i had to combine so many medications it would not be fair to discuss side effects. i hope this medicine works better for others.""",1
Quinapril,"""took it for a little over 6 months - quinapril hcl 40mg along with amlodipine besylate 5mg and 1/2 a pill of hydrochlorothiazide 50mg. the cough got to be excessive. of course i do smoke, but i know the difference between smokers cough and something else. switched to benicar 20mg, after 7 days side effects just too much and it is so expensive. quit the benicar. the coughing is very annoying but will have to try it again as it is like the only medicine that i can afford right now. everyone is different but it is okay as far as i am concerned for me.""",7
Wellbutrin,"""i had trouble with anxiety and having a ""short fuse"". i thought about death constantly and had trouble remembering things. in short i suffered from depression. i was horrible to my coworkers, family, and friends. i have never taken an antidepressant before. i have been taking wellbutrin for 5 days and i can say that i feel better. i have energy, although i have noticed some heart palpitations...nothing worth seeing a dr about. i have a decreased appetite but just slight nausea. i am in a better mood and seem to be able to let things that used to bother me just slide by. i do not feel like a zombie at all. i smile more and cry less. that's exactly what i was hoping for. i am a 45 year old woman.""",8

Citalopram,"""mom was put on 10 mg. then dr. increased to 20 mg and her husband passed away and dr. increased to 40 mg. she kept falling, blacking out, dizzy spells. i kept asking dr. if it could be any of her medications and they said no. then she started having signs and symptoms of alzheimer's. on her first diagnosis she was diagnosed with advanced alz. 
we saw no signs or family history of alz. you see that coming 4-5 years out. after fighting this for 4 months after diagnosis, i decided the only thing that was changed was adding celexa, so i weened her off celexa and in 3 weeks w had our mom back from alz, state that she was in.""",1
Clonidine,"""i was given 0.2 mg of clonidine after having a hypertensive crises due to an interaction between a maoi and another antidepressant. the first dose of clonidine (0.2) brought my blood pressure from 208/163 to around 140/110, at which point i was ready to head to the er, where i got other meds. a few days later i had another crisis, but this one not as bad as the first: 173/140. the scary thing about the second crisis was that it took a total of 0.3 mg of clonidine to get my blood pressure to go down even a little. but overall, thank god for the clonidine! maybe woulda had a stroke or something without it. my skin was all purple and the whites of my eyes were completely bright red, so i think the blood was trying to get out somehow.""",10

Maxalt,"""for me maxalt is a miracle drug. i have tried almost everything otc, and nothing worked. excedrin worked for awhile, then after a few weeks, it stopped working. i can always count on maxalt to get rid of my migraines. i usually feel relief within an hour of taking it. that being said ,this drug is very expensive. even with insurance and taking the generic version, i am still out of pocket about $50 a box, and they only give you 12 pills. sometimes i have 3 or 4 migraines in a week, so this can get really expensive. it works wonders for me though, so unfortunately it's a necessary expense.""",9
Elimite,"""i've had scabies several times, unfortunately, mainly due to travelling.  elimite is easy to use, but remember for the treatment to be effective you must disinfect all surfaces you have come into contact with.  you must vacuum furniture, wash all bedding in hot water with chlorine bleach or color safe bleach in addition to detergent.  clothing and shoes: when in doubt, throw it out.  and make sure to have household members treated, or at least on the lookout if they develop symptoms.""",9

Clindamycin,"""i am not sure what the issue is with people having these crazy side effects. i know people will can have some type of side effects but, to completely bash this med is irresponsible. if side effects are happening either a. the dose is to high, i suggest talking to your doc to re adjust it (high doses of ab's aren't always a good thing) or b.take zofran along side it, this helps with the stomach issues (warning: it can cause constipation). do not lay down for at least an hour after taking it, and take it with a standard 16.9 fl oz water bottle. the only con for me is the size of a 300mg capsule(if you have a phobia or issues about swallowing big pills, use the smaller 150mgx2)""",9
Contrave,"""i've had an excellent experience on this medication. i have ben on the medication and it is now close to the time where i need to wean off.  i have had side effects from this medication, though they were short lived and tolerable. during the 1st 6 weeks (+/- a week), i experienced nausea, head aches, borborygmus (or a loud active sounding intestinal tract). i did not have any vomiting or diarrhea ever. i did occasionally experience constipation which was alleviated by taking colace (1-2 pills 1-2 times daily as needed).  i began this journey almost a year ago to the date. i started out at 166 lbs (5'4) and moderately overweight. i am now healthier and happier. i currently weight 138 lbs and have a target weight of 135 lbs.  very successful.""",9

Sertraline,"""i've suffered from anxiety my whole life. it was exacerbated 11years ago when i gave birth to my daughter at 17. i've tried so many different medications with horrible side effects. i'm diagnosed with ptsd and hypervigilance so no side effect, no matter how minuscule, slipped by me. during my last bad episode of depression/anxiety, i reluctantly agreed to try sertraline. my dr started the lowest dose possible, 25mg (lower than she had ever prescribed) in the hopes it would ease my anxiety about side effects. i'm now on 75mg a day and so happy i finally found the medication that works for me! my only side effect is night sweats and vivid dreams. don't give up! sertraline is med #4 i've tried and the first one that really worked for me.""",10
Chlordiazepoxide,"""i have found librium/chlordiazepoxide to be very effective during a relatively short time (few months) of acute anxiety accompanied by ibs. my doctor prescribed librium and it has been very effective. being in the medical field myself, it is important to note that while librium may not have the sharp relief impacts of say ativan (just as an example), yet it is still a very effective and potent benzodiazepine that works on the same receptors in the brain that other benzodiazepines do. with my anxiety causing stomach issues, my doctor said librium should help with both and, thankfully, it has greatly. i am calm, able to think things through, and go throughout the day on 50mg able to be more productive/less anxious and sleep better at night!""",8

not to mention the vivid, hallucenenic type nightmares and the constant feeling of paranoia and feeling on the brink of a panic attack!! if you have anxiety like i do do not take this unless you have to!!! i had a mental breakdown about taking another dose as i don't feel i can handle these side effects much longer.

Implanon,"""i used implanon for 6 year with 2 insertions. it was very effective and i loved not having to worry about birth control for such a long period of time. the only reason i had it removed was because i would have a heavy period for months at a time. i was on my period for more than half the time i had the implanon. when i had it removed, i noticed my face clear up and i lost a small amount of weight. i have a friend who had implanon and she had it removed due to complete lack of periods. she couldn't stand being irregular. so implanon seems to have a big effect on periods.""",9

Xanax,"""i suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, so xanax has served as my ""safety net"" in times of distress. when taken as prescribed, those of us who need it simply feel like life is bearable again. those nagging irrational thought patterns and worries are silenced.

however, xanax is not a medicine to be taken lightly (hence the bad reputation it's received). it's short half-life causes cravings to re-dose (vs klonopin, which never gives me those feelings). use in moderation, and make an effort to see a cognitive-behavioral therapist if you haven't done so.""",10

over the course of 18 months, my vaginal discharge disappeared.  it made sex so painful that it's impossible.  it also cause stress incontinence.  i've been off it for six months and the lack of discharge still a problem because i'm apparently not allowed to have any type of estrogen.""",1

Silodosin,"""i have a prostate infection with an enlarged prostate and urinary issues. i was given flomax (30 days) initially with antibiotics but the flomax made me dizzy and a bad stuffed up nose. i was then given rapaflo to help treat the benign prostate hyperplasia and felt only a slight stuffy nose and of course the most common side effect no ejaculation. these side effects are common. this medication is important in treating bph and infections. i now have no discomfort and urinate freely. i still have two weeks to go. i won't stop taking it until the 30 days are up per doctors orders.
for those people who are worried about the no ejaculation side effect, i have to say stick through and win the war. it will come back. skipping or less sex for a month is worth it to get back to normal.""",9

results: mixed. the depo did stop the night sweats and mood swings, i never get my monthly break-out, and i've found that i've lost some weight because i'm no longer bloated. that's the good news. the bad news: i spotted or bleed continuously to the point where i became slightly anemic and needed a second hormone based b.c. to get the bleeding stopped.""",7

my sleep was deep and quite refreshing and nothing made me anxious during the entirety of the time it was in my system.

Lamotrigine,"""lamotrigine is an excellent medication for bipolar ii. it helps to even out your mood, but what i found most definitely is helping the depression. sure it takes a long time to establish a ""sweet spot dose"" but it's worth the wait. the only troublesome side effect i have had is vision issues, primarily blurred vision -- not debilitating but irritating, yes.""",9
Modafinil,"""i started taking provigil about a year ago when it was suspected i had narcolepsy.  i was tested and found it was idiotic hypersomnia (lack of melatonin) they call it idiotic because they don't know what causes it. provigil works one day for me then not the next.  you can only take 200mg max per day. i went off it and on ritalin.  i am awake without any ill effects.  i have recently been tested again for narcolepsy and was found that i am narcoleptic.  the test given last year was done incorrectly (without my c-pap), it was supposed to be done with it on during my sleep study. all is good now.""",2

Clonidine,"""this is a very effective medication but with extreme side effects. it is very short-lived and requires dividing the prescribed dosage into 3 times a day to avoid blood pressure spikes. it leaves you feeling ""high"" and sedated. absolutely do not discontinue it abruptly. stopping it abruptly causes your blood pressure to rebound even higher than it was before for several days.

a better choice in this class is guanfacine, which for me is even more effective and does not have the radical side effects.""",7

Chlorhexidine,"""chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% oral rinse should also be dispensed in half pint bottles as a pint bottle is way too much for patients to use after many dental surgeries.

following the directions i used 14 ounces out of 32 ounces leaving 28 ounces that i cannot use. 

dispensing more than a half pint was:

cons
you cannot take this medication everyday no matter what the doctor tells you. maybe it's my body or something but i can promise you, your body will soon reject the medication if taken everyday for more than 5 days. 
if continued in such a fashion, you will bloat, cramp and become more constipated than before. it will plug you up for real. it's not strong enough to make you go a lot the next day if you need it.take a weak laxative with it.

Fycompa,"""my daughter has had refractory epilepsy for 20yrs. she tried this drug in addition to the vimpat and topamax she is already taking. huge mistake!  week 2 she became  catatonic,  delusional, and terrified. her dad ,brother and i helped her through it. called her neurologist and stopped the drug immediately. we are on day one without the fycompa,  our morning was consumed with a psychotic episode but after an hr and a half she came around. lucky for her she doesn't remember much if anything of these events.  i highly recommend you do your research before considering this drug. in my opinion it shouldn't be on the market.""",1
Adalimumab,"""humira was my first medicine to try for recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis. had to stop after the 2nd injection due to nausea, lethargy, my teeth hurt and had 3/4 migraines a week. trying a new medicine now and hope to see results. humira has a discount program that you only pay $5 for. ask your doc about it!""",2
Plan B,"""well this is the second time i have had to take it. i am not making this a routine but accidents do happen. the last time was several months ago. i use to be on the iud but i continued to have problems with it. i have tried several pills as well but to no avail , my body does not handle them well either. i am considering sterilization but my husband said he would do it. so this is why i have had this experience. one thing i noticed is plan b has worked for me. i have mood changes similar to pms for a few days. after about a week (7 days) i begin spotting and start my period. i am thankful but it does work  a week after you ended your last period. i can only blame myself. plan b has worked for me.""",9
Levothyroxine,"""just diagnosed, my tsh has been in the 20s-30s, my t3 and t4 are at the low low range.  doctor says i have subclinical hypothyroidism.  i refused the medicine for a month, lost 15 pounds, ate healthy, exercised, quit smoking, and was perfect.  unfortunately, tsh did not change.  started the medicine -- felt euphoric first few days.  around day 5... i felt like something was ""coming back"".  a feeling that i lost 11 years ago when i was 18yrs old (something i gave up trying to fix when i was 20yrs old).  i'm excited by the possibility that perhaps it was my thyroid and i can treat it now. eager to see how i feel in a couple months!  i think i need more than 75mcg.  i have no side effects at all.""",7
Differin,"""after benzoyl peroxide made my skin worse, i was prescribed differin cream 0.1%. results were slow at first but with maintaining a good skincare routine and healthy diet my skin showed huge improvements after about 2-3 months of use. little side effects, some dryness but as to be expected with any acne product and easily resolved with moisturiser. felt a lot less harsh on my skin than benzoyl peroxide. i am left with some spots and scarring but the effects have been overall brilliant. would reccommend sticking with it for a few months to see best results!""",8
Minocycline,"""solodyn cleared up my acne within just a few days, minimal side effects. cleared up my acne and made my skin actually stay clear, i haven't had any acne for about a month""",10
Oxymorphone,"""male, mid 30's, 2 herniated lumbar discs, 3 pinched nerves, bone spur, stenosis.. i have been on pain meds for the last 10 years, and opana is by far the most effective paid med i've ever tried and believe me i've been on everything.. most recently i was on oxycontin 20mg 1x a day and oxycodone ir 20mg 5x a day.. the problem with oxycodone is that it has a very low half life of 3-4 hours and is very addictive because of the short duration of action you find yourself ""chasing the pain"".. i suggested opana to my pm doctor as i heard good things about it, best pain relief i've had in years! i take opana er 40mg 2x a day and opana ir 10mg 2x a day prn for breakthrough pain.. this med is a wonder drug for those in 24/7 chronic pain!""",10
Escitalopram,"""if youre reading reviews right now, debating trying this, do it right now. i was so anxious to try this, i thought i was gonna be a zombie. its only my first day taking it and i just want to let you know the side effects are very doable. slight nausea, slight headaches, a little confusion, a little more alert. honestly, if i wasn't paying attention to them i wouldn't even probably notice i'm having side effects....(i'm  sensitive to medications by the way) i say give this a shot, i know new medications can be scary but you never know, it can be your miracle drug.""",10
Ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone,"""this pill changed my life! i suffered from such bad cramps before that i would be throwing up nonstop for hours. i now barely have to take advil when i get my period, my periods only last 4 days too. i do not break out, no mood swings also! i did gain a slight amount of weight but nothing too big. love it! going on year 2 now of being on lolo!""",10
Pimecrolimus,"""i've suffered from eczema since childhood and elidel completely eradicated the severe eczema lesions behind my knees.  while i still have a few spots that pop up during the winter, elidel keeps it controlled.  very effective cream, just very pricey.""",9
Atorvastatin,"""43 year old male been on 20mg lipitor for 3 months, alot of side effects for first month mainly muscle spasms and uneasy stomach. cholesterol went from 240 to 120, cut dose in half, and no more side effects.""",10
Viberzi,"""i have suffered from severe ibs-d for the past 5 years. i was continuing to get worse, it seemed like i tried everything and i still had more bad days than good. i had cut out gluten, all dairy, coffee, pretty much every possible trigger i cut out of my diet. i was on levsin three times daily and i also still had to take immodium in between. i could take three immodium and it still would not stop my diarrhea. it would last for an entire day even after taking medication. i was at my wits end. my doctor had me try viberzi at the end of december. she put me on 75 mg twice daily. so far it has been fantastic! i am much improved. i went two weeks straight without an episode of diarrhea and it has been years since i've gone that long!""",9
Sumatriptan,"""this review is for the injectable form of imitrex (sumatriptan) only. for anyone that has tried the pill or nasal spray forms and found them ineffective, please try the injections. they work wonders and act fast. i've tried the other types and they actually seemed to make me more nauseous and (especially the nasal spray).  i keep one in my purse at all times so that i can get relief anytime a migraine hits. the pain is not bad as the needle is very small and thin. you don't have to jab yourself, just press against your skin and push a button. the pain of migraine is much worse! i've found the most comfortable injection site to be the bit of fat at the top of my buttox. i use the 6mg injections but i'm pretty sure there is also a lower dose.""",9
Aleve,"""my hip and shoulder have hurt for years and i have always taken bayer aspirin and i tried aleve arthritis gelcap.  to my surprise the pain in my hip and shoulder went away for 8 hours.  the only thing i don't know is how long i could take the stuff, the bottle said do not take for longer than 10 days.  the warning label about it could cause stroke or heart attack did raise questions.""",9
Fluvoxamine,"""my psychiatrist prescribed me luvox 100mg that i've been on for close to 2 months to help me deal with symptoms of stress and social anxiety.  i would say the medication works but the side effects aren't worth me continuing it so i'm going to see about something else that is proven to have less side effects.  some of the side effects i was experiencing were difficulty staying asleep and waking up with night sweats, dry mouth, and sore throat.  i think zoloft worked better for me.""",6
Levetiracetam,"""i had my first episode when i was 12 months. the side effects i get are decrease in appetite, forget minor things, & headaches. they couldn't tell what was wrong with me at that time. at the age of 12 years old i had my 2nd episode in my sleep. i found myself crawling to my parents room because i couldn't walk or talk correctly. when i went to the hospital they diagnosed me with epilepsy. what causes my seizures is an enlarge blood vessel on the right side of my brain. i started off with 750mg of levetiracetam. i only had episodes when i missed 1-3 days of my medicine. now i will be 19 years old in april & i am now taking 500mg of levetiracetam. they're lowering the doses as i get older.""",7
Levonorgestrel,"""this morning i read reviews about liletta in a last minute approach to prepare myself for it getting placed today. it was inserted about 2 hours ago and thus far the worst part was the 45 minute wait before i was seen. the procedure itself was very quick and only mildly uncomfortable, it took about 5 minutes total. i'm on the last days of my first period since giving birth to my son 7 weeks ago. i'm not positive if either of those things are factors in the ease of the procedure for me, but it was basically a breeze. i've had some light cramping and back pain, but i'd much rather have that once than to take a pill every day.""",8
Sanctura XR,"""i have had interstitial cystitis my entire life. i had very painful periods and always felt uncomfortable. i started this wonderful medicine and the pain has stopped. i don't hurt anymore. take as soon as you wake up 1 hour before you eat! works best this way!""",10
Etonogestrel,"""nexplanon had me very optimistic and hopeful at first. nope! not anymore. i've been bleeding heavily for about a month straight and i've been spotting since the first week i got it ! do not get nexplanon. it made my anxiety so so so much worse ( so bad i was hospitalized for it). i'm getting it out next month and i can't wait to feel like myself again!""",1

Lupron Depot,"""i've been on lupron since march 2015. just had my 2nd shot. i have to tell you it's taken 100% of my nagging back pain and cramps away. i even lost 12 pounds the first shot. it started to wear out towards the end so i took the shot 2 weeks early. i had surgery may 12th to remove a huge polyp and 2 fibroid tumors  - all benign. i'm having hot flashes and some headaches, some joint pain and that's about it. these symptoms are worth the trade from previous symptoms. i only hope my doctor gives me a hysterectomy soon. she feels lupron will shrink the fibroids outside my uterus. i'm almost 50 so she says i should hold off on the hysterectomy. i want all this done with. good luck to all of you.""",10
Amphetamine / dextroamphetamine,"""used to treat both my extreme fatigue and my treatment-resistant bipolar depression, this medicine has changed my life.  without it, my other meds in my cocktail made it impossible for me to do much besides sleep all day, made my concentration nonexistant during manic and mixed states, and my depressions were darker and longer-lasting.  i was also unable to work.  with my other medications, i now lead a normal life, can read, write, and otherwise concentrate on whatever i need or want to do, don't stay in bed all day, have energy, rarely am depressed, and contrary to some doctor's lectures, using this medication has not caused manic or mixed states.  indeed, i have not experienced a single manic, mixed, or hypomanic state in years.""",10

Levonorgestrel,"""my son and daughter are 18 months apart so bc was needed. i wanted a bc that i didn't have to worry about daily so mirena seemed like the perfect choice...especially since all my friends raved about it. it's horrible! i got it inserted february 2015 during my 6wks follow-up after my son was born. i bled everyday until  may. i have to wear a liner everyday now b/c i never know when i'll bleed (heavy or lite)...my poor husband! my hair is thinning.  i get headaches like everyday, along with cramping. this shit is awful. i'm getting it removed next month...i wish there was an appointment available sooo much sooner though!""",2
Meloxicam,"""injury in my letf glut = sciatica. pain strikes without warning & literally makes me gasp & grab onto something. then it's a constant throbbing / sharp pain shooting from butt to little toe. good: 15mg at bedtime; 3 days = no pain. no pain getting out of bed, no cringing at a flight of stairs, no  having to sit in epsom salt baths until i'm a prune - no pain. bad: i had never been constipated. never. until mobic. i needed softeners,  fibre & finally laxative = limited success. ugly: real  10lb weight gain. miserable/ want to faint 1000 calories a day for 3 weeks = 1 lb loss. 2 weeks off mobic = all weight off but pain is back. 600mg ibuprofen = useless. so my choice is fat or in pain. harder decision than you think. maybe tramadol?""",5
