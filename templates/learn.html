                <p style="margin-left:10px;"> Due to some unconditional situations demand of medicines increases. So, demand forecasting of medicine should be accurate to overcome this problem. Our system will focus on this problem and will help to overcome the issue.<br>In our system we are using social networking data because, recently, social network services, such as Facebook and Twitter, have become indispensable to the online activities of people, and they produce a huge amount of data on individuals' interests in everyday life.<br>Through this data we came to know how people are facing shortage of medicines and in our project, we are predicting that how much the percentage of a medicine should be required or enough in an area for future needs of people which will also be helpful to overcome unconditional situations. </p>

But we are using social networking data because now most of the people are connected through social media now a days and share information about current issues. So social media data sometimes are most efficient to predict a conclusion.<br>So, by predicting demand forecast of medicine through social networking data describes future customer demand and growing of company.
